
# A Virtual Date!

![](https://github.com/QuetzalcoutlDev/Virtual-Date/blob/main/assets/images/logo.png?raw=true)

Virtual Date! or A Virtual Date! is a dating sim game written in Python using the Pygame module and my own Len'Py module.

It was developed for GitHub Game Off 2022, but unfortunately couldn't be delivered on time.

This game is just a prototype, so it can be seen that some features are missing, and also that I cannot guarantee that it is bug free.


## Facility

You can install the game in several ways, simply by downloading it from my page at [itch.io](https://quetzalcoutl.itch.io/virtual-date) or you can install it by downloading the source code and compiling it manually.

### Installing from source

First of all, you need to have a source code editor to be able to view or modify the game code, you can use Sublime Text, Atom or Visual Studio Code.

If you decided to install it manually, you should follow my steps to avoid errors:

1. You need to have Python version 3.7.1 or higher,
2. Download Pygame version 2.1.2, you can install it with the `pip` command if you already installed Python

On Windows:

`pip install pygame==2.1.2`

On Linux:

`python3 -m pip install pygame==2.1.2`

3. Download Len'Py 0.1.2 or higher, you can install it with the `pip` command but I'd rather download and install it manually: https://github.com/QuetzalcoutlDev/Lenpy or https://quetzalcoutl.itch.io/lenpy, because sometimes I forget to update it in the PyPi.

On Windows:

`pip install lenpy`

On Linux:

`python3 -m pip install lenpy`

4. For the compilation you need to install PyInstaller or Nuitka, I used Pyinstaller, but they are really optional since you can run the game without compiling.

Part of the soundtrack composed by Joack Kenny for Lonely Imagination was used in the game due to time constraints.

## Notes

1. This game is free (GNU GPL v3) and open source.
2. It's just a prototype.
3. You are limited to a 1000 x 520 screen only for certain reasons.
4. The English translation is not verified and is not 100% correct.
5. Use part of the Lonely Imagination soundtrack due to time constraints.
